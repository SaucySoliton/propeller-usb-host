------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a software implementation of a simple full-speed
(12 Mb/s) USB 1.1 host controller for the Parallax Propeller.

This module is a self-contained USB stack, including host
controller driver, host controller, and a bit-banging PHY layer.

Software implementations of low-speed (1.5 Mb/s) USB have become
fairly common, but full-speed pushes the limits of even a fairly
powerful microcontroller like the Propeller. So naturally, we
had to cut some corners. See the sizable list of limitations and
caveats below.

Hardware Requirements
---------------------

 - 80 MHz Propeller
 - USB D- attached to P0 with a 47 ohm series resistor
 - USB D+ attached to P1 with a 47 ohm series resistor
 - A spare IO pin to leave unconnected
 - Pull-down resistors (~47k ohm) from USB D- and D+ to ground

  Note: For maximum compatibility and at least some semblance of
        USB spec compliance, all four of these resistors are
        required. And the pull-down resistors are definitely
        necessary if you want to detect device connect/disconnect
        state. However, if you are permanently attaching a single
        device to your Propeller, depending on the device you
        may be able to omit the pull-down resistors and connect
        D-/D+ directly to P0/P1. I recommend you only try this if
        you know what you're doing and/or you're brave :)

  Note: You can modify DPLUS and DMINUS below, to change the pins we use
        for the USB port. This can only be done at compile-time so far,
        since a lot of compile-time literals rely on these values. Also,
        not all pins are supported. Both DPLUS and DMINUS must be between
        P0 and P7, inclusive.

Limitations and Caveats
-----------------------

 - Supports only a single device.
   (One host controller, one port, no hubs.)

 - Pin numbers are currently hardcoded as P0 and P1.
   Clock speed is hardcoded as 80 MHz

 - Requires 2 cogs.

   (We need a peak of 2 cogs during receive, but one
   of them is idle at other times.)

 - Maximum transmitted packet size is approx. 430 bytes (NEEDS UPDATE)
   Maximum received packet size is approx. 1024 bytes (NEEDS UPDATE)

 - Doesn't even pretend to adhere to the USB spec!
   May not work with all USB devices.

 - Full speed receiver is single-ended and uses a fixed clock rate.
   Does not tolerate line noise well, so use short USB
   cables if you must use a cable at all.

 - Maximum average speed is much less than line rate,
   due to time spent pre-encoding and post-decoding.

 - SOF packets do not have an incrementing frame number
   SOF packets may not be sent on-time due to other traffic

 - We don't detect TX buffer overruns. If it hurts,
   don't do it. The RX has some protections against overrun,
   mostly untested. (Also, do not use this HC with untrusted
   devices- a babble condition can overwrite cog memory.)

Theory of Operation
-------------------

With the Propeller overclocked to 96 MHz, we have 8 clock cycles
(2 instructions) for every bit. That isn't nearly enough! So, we
cheat, and we do as much work as possible either before sending
a packet, after receiving a packet, or concurrently on another cog.

One cog is responsible for the bulk of the host controller
implementation. This is the transmit/controller cog. It accepts
commands from Spin code, handles pre-processing transmitted
data and post-processing received data, and oversees the process
of sending and receiving packets.

The grunt work of actually transmitting and receiving data is
offloaded from this cog. Transmit is handled by the TX cog's video
generator hardware. It's programmed in "VGA" mode to send two-byte
"pixels" to the D+/D- pins every 8 clock cycles. We pre-calculate
a buffer of "video" data representing each transmitted packet.

The receiver gets some help from the counters. At 80MHz we have
20 clocks or 5 instructions for every 3 bits. The counter
can store incoming bits by adding them to the PHS register.
The cog must do the shifting. So, 3 of the 5 instructions
are committed to shifting the FRQ register. We can use the other
2 for things like reading and storing the incoming data.
This ratio between clocks and instructions makes it harder to
fill a 32 bit long. We store 30 bits per long to keep things
simple.

A slight complication of using the counter as an input shift
register is that we should add each bit exactly once. The
logic A&B mode works well. A counter in duty mode produces pulses
one clock wide at a configurable frequency and phase, exactly
what we need to sample the input once per bit.  We have to use a
pin to route the sampling clock from one counter to another.

We use this pin for some additional functions as well:
 *  Waking the RX cog with waitpxx to avoid polling hub ram.
 *  Signals the receiver to start so we don't need to calculate a wakeup time.
 *  Used as a watchdog timer for the LS receiver.
 *  Enables faster upload to hub by using timers to increment address.

In USB FS receive:
   CTRA produces 12 MHz pulses in duty mode.

While receiving LS data:
    CTRA is used in NCO mode to act as a watchdog timer for the LS receiver.

While uploading data to hub:
   CTRA produces  5 MHz pulses in duty mode.
   CTRB adds 4 the hub address for each pulse received.



The low speed receiver was designed with the following goals:
 1. Small size
 2. Easy to write
 3. Wide bitrate tolerance
Low speed devices may use resonators, which are less accurate than crystals.
The USB spec allows 1.5 % tolerance for low speed devices.
Host controllers must be within 0.05 %.
Some code written for USB device receivers may assume this tight tolerence.
To be a reliable host controller, we need to accept the wider 1.5 % range.
This receiver can theoretically tolerate 5.0 % error.

It is possible to receive and un-stuff low speed USB in real time. The codes
that do this are longer and may not have the bitrate tolerance we want.
Also, longer code reduces the size of the full speed receive buffer.

Instead of trying to sample the bits, we measure the time between transitions.
Then we calculate how many bits fit between the transitions.
This post-processing time is roughly equal to the reception time.



The other demanding operation we need to perform is a data IN
transfer. We need to transmit a token, receive a data packet, then
transmit an ACK. All back-to-back, with just a handful of bit
periods between packets. This is handled by some dedicated code
on the TX cog that does nothing but send low-latency ACKs after
the EOP state.

Since it takes much longer to decode and validate a packet than
we have before we must send an ACK, we use an inefficient but
effective "deferred ACK" strategy for IN transfers.


Programming Model
-----------------

This should look a little familiar to anyone who's written USB
drivers for a PC operating system, or used a user-level USB library
like libusb.

Public functions are provided for each supported transfer type.
(BulkRead, BulkWrite, InterruptRead...) These functions take an
endpoint descriptor, hub memory buffer, and buffer size.

All transfers are synchronous. (So, during a transfer itself,
we're really tying up 5 cogs if you count the one you called from.)
All transfers and most other functions can 'abort' with an error code.
See the E_* constants below. You must use the '\' prefix on function
calls if you want to catch these errors.

Since the transfer functions need to know both an endpoint's address
and its maximum packet size, we refer to endpoints by passing around
pointers to the endpoint's descriptor. In fact, this is how we refer
to interfaces too. This object keeps an in-memory copy of the
configuration descriptor we're using, so this data is always handy.
There are high-level functions for iterating over a device's
descriptors.

When a device is attached, call Enumerate to reset and identify it.
After Enumerate, the device will be in the 'addressed' state. It
will not be configured yet, but we'll have a copy of the device
descriptor and the first configuration descriptor in memory. To use
that default configuration, you can immediately call Configure. Now
the device is ready to use.

This host controller is a singleton object which is intended to
be instantiated only once per Propeller. Multiple objects can declare
OBJs for the host controller, but they will all really be sharing the
same instance. This will prevent you from adding multiple USB
controllers to one system, but there are also other reasons that we
don't currently support that. It's convenient, though, because this
means multiple USB device drivers can use separate instances of the
host controller OBJ to speak to the same USB port. Each device driver
can be invoked conditionally based on the device's class(es).

  ' This implements our crazy "deferred ACK" scheme, to work around
  ' the fact that we can't decode a packet fast enough to check it prior
  ' to sending the ACK when we're supposed to. In this strategy, we send
  ' multiple IN tokens for each actual packet we intend to read, and postpone
  ' the ACK by one packet. The first packet is never acknowledged. The second
  ' will be ACK'ed only if the first was checked successfully. And so on.
  ' Normally this means that there are two packets: The first one is decoded
  ' but not ACKed, and the second one is ACKed but the contents are ignored.
  ' (We assume it's identical to the first.)
  '
  ' To use deferred ACKs, set txrxFlag to TXRX_TX_RX. To ACK the first
  ' response (before the CRC check) set txrxFlag to TXRX_TX_RX_ACK.
  ' If deferred ACKs are NOT in use, crcRetries must be 1.
  '
  ' We're currently using deferred ACKs only for Bulk and Interrupt INs.
  ' Some devices don't handle non-acknowledged IN packets during control
  ' transfers, so we still have the possibility of CRC errors during control
  ' reads. Luckily, most such transfers can be retried at a higher
  ' protocol level.

    ' The process of actually decoding the received packet is a bit convoluted,
    ' due to the split of responsibilities between the RX cogs, TX cog, and
    ' Spin code:
    '
    '   - The RX cogs don't really detect the EOP condition, they just stop when
    '     the D- line has been zero for a while. But they do record an accurate
    '     SOP timestamp.
    '
    '   - The TX cog records a fairly accurate EOP timestamp
    '
    '   - Spin code uses these timestamps to figure out the maximum number of
    '     bits that reside in a packet, minus the CRC and header.
    '
    '   - The decoder is given both a bit and byte limit, so it stops writing
    '     when either the buffer fills up or we reach the calculated EOP minus
    '     CRC position.

    ' Calculate the actual packet length.
    '
    ' RequestDataIN returns an EOP timestamp. The TX cog knew when the EOP
    ' was, and the RX2 cog knew when SOP was. We're running at 8 clocks
    ' per bit, or 64 clocks per byte. Convert clocks to bits.
    '
    ' We subtract enough bits to cover the CRC-16 and PID. The decoder needs us
    ' to account for slightly less bits than we're actually receiving, since it
    ' stops after the bit count underflows. To round evenly we could subtract half
    ' a byte, but we only subtract a couple due to the additional CRC-16 bit stuffing
    ' bits we haven't accounted for. (These are guaranteed to cause less than one
    ' byte's worth of difference in the calculation if we do this right.)
    '
    ' The full offset calculation is:
    '
    '    headerBits   = 16

    '    roundingBits = 4
