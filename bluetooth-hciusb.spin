USB Bluetooth HCI driver for the Parallax Propeller.

You can use this module directly if you'd like low-level access to the
Bluetooth adapter, but this module does not provide any support for
higher-level protocols like SDP, L2CAP, and RFCOMM. Those protocols
are implemented by the companion bluetooth-host.spin object.

This implements the low-level Bluetooth Host Controller Interface (HCI)
using the USB transport, via the software USB host controller object.
See usb-fs-host.spin for information on attaching USB device hardware
to the Propeller.
