bluetooth-keyring
------------------------------------------------------------------

The keyring module is responsible for storing link keys for devices
we're paired with. We have room to store a fixed number of link
keys in RAM, so we keep track of the most recently used keys and
evict old ones when necessary. When a new key is stored, we back
up our data to EEPROM.

To maintain robustness even if power loss occurs during a write,
we keep the link keys on EEPROM pages which don't overlap with any
other code or data, and we use simple data structures that can't
be put into an inconsistent state.

We want to store how 'recent' a key is, but we also don't want
any easily corruptable data structures like linked lists. We'd also
like to rewrite the fewest number of pages possible when updating
the stored keys. So we choose a 32-bit generation number. Each time
we write a new key, we look for the highest generation number and
add one. A 32-bit number is larger than the expected number of cycles
in the EEPROM's lifetime, so we should not expect overflow. If overflow
occurs, it means there was data corruption- so the whole keyring should
be zeroed.
