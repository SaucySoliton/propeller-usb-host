USB Mass Storage Class driver for the Parallax Propeller.

This module provides several interfaces:
  - A low-level SCSI interface
  - A simple sector read/write interface
  - An FSRW compatibility shim, so this module can be
    used with FSRW as an sdspi module.

This is a pretty simple driver that just implements the bulk-only
protocol, and has limited error handling ability. This module
provides support for raw SCSI commands, and it implements simple
block-level read/write entry points.
