------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a software implementation of a simple full-speed
(12 Mb/s) USB 1.1 host controller for the Parallax Propeller.

This module is a self-contained USB stack, including host
controller driver, host controller, and a bit-banging PHY layer.

Software implementations of low-speed (1.5 Mb/s) USB have become
fairly common, but full-speed pushes the limits of even a fairly
powerful microcontroller like the Propeller. So naturally, I
had to cut some corners. See the sizable list of limitations and
caveats below.

Hardware Requirements
---------------------

 - 96 MHz (overclocked) Propeller
 - USB D- attached to P0 with a 47 ohm series resistor
 - USB D+ attached to P1 with a 47 ohm series resistor
 - Pull-down resistors (~47k ohm) from USB D- and D+ to ground

              - - -

  Note: For maximum compatibility and at least some semblance of
        USB spec compliance, all four of these resistors are
        required. And the pull-down resistors are definitely
        necessary if you want to detect device connect/disconnect
        state. However, if you are permanently attaching a single
        device to your Propeller, depending on the device you
        may be able to omit the pull-down resistors and connect
        D-/D+ directly to P0/P1. I recommend you only try this if
        you know what you're doing and/or you're brave :)

  Note: You can modify DPLUS and DMINUS below, to change the pins we use
        for the USB port. This can only be done at compile-time so far,
        since a lot of compile-time literals rely on these values. Also,
        not all pins are supported. Both DPLUS and DMINUS must be between
        P0 and P7, inclusive.

Limitations and Caveats
-----------------------

 - Supports only a single device.
   (One host controller, one port, no hubs.)

 - Pin numbers are currently hardcoded as P0 and P1.
   Clock speed is hardcoded as 96 MHz (overclocked)

 - Requires 3 cogs.

   (We need a peak of 3 cogs during receive, but two
   of them are idle at other times. There is certainly
   room for improvement...)

 - Maximum transmitted packet size is approx. 430 bytes
   Maximum received packet size is approx. 1024 bytes

 - Doesn't even pretend to adhere to the USB spec!
   May not work with all USB devices.

 - Receiver is single-ended and uses a fixed clock rate.
   Does not tolerate line noise well, so use short USB
   cables if you must use a cable at all.

 - Maximum average speed is much less than line rate,
   due to time spent pre-encoding and post-decoding.

 - SOF packets do not have an incrementing frame number
   SOF packets may not be sent on-time due to other traffic

 - We don't detect TX/RX buffer overruns. If it hurts,
   don't do it. (Also, do not use this HC with untrusted
   devices- a babble condition can overwrite cog memory.)

Theory of Operation
-------------------

With the Propeller overclocked to 96 MHz, we have 8 clock cycles
(2 instructions) for every bit. That isn't nearly enough! So, we
cheat, and we do as much work as possible either before sending
a packet, after receiving a packet, or concurrently on another cog.

One cog is responsible for the bulk of the host controller
implementation. This is the transmit/controller cog. It accepts
commands from Spin code, handles pre-processing transmitted
data and post-processing received data, and oversees the process
of sending and receiving packets.

The grunt work of actually transmitting and receiving data is
offloaded from this cog. Transmit is handled by the TX cog's video
generator hardware. It's programmed in "VGA" mode to send two-byte
"pixels" to the D+/D- pins every 8 clock cycles. We pre-calculate
a buffer of "video" data representing each transmitted packet.

Receiving is harder- there's no hardware to help. In software, we
can test a port and shift its value into a buffer in 8 clock cycles,
but we don't have time to do anything else. So we can receive bursts
that are limited by cog memory. To receive continuously, this module
uses two receive cogs, and carefully interleaves them. Each cog
receives 16 bits at a time.

The other demanding operation we need to perform is a data IN
transfer. We need to transmit a token, receive a data packet, then
transmit an ACK. All back-to-back, with just a handful of bit
periods between packets. This is handled by some dedicated code
on the TX cog that does nothing but send low-latency ACKs after
the EOP state.

Since it takes much longer to decode and validate a packet than
we have before we must send an ACK, we use an inefficient but
effective "deferred ACK" strategy for IN transfers.


Programming Model
-----------------

This should look a little familiar to anyone who's written USB
drivers for a PC operating system, or used a user-level USB library
like libusb.

Public functions are provided for each supported transfer type.
(BulkRead, BulkWrite, InterruptRead...) These functions take an
endpoint descriptor, hub memory buffer, and buffer size.

All transfers are synchronous. (So, during a transfer itself,
we're really tying up 5 cogs if you count the one you called from.)
All transfers and most other functions can 'abort' with an error code.
See the E_* constants below. You must use the '\' prefix on function
calls if you want to catch these errors.

Since the transfer functions need to know both an endpoint's address
and its maximum packet size, we refer to endpoints by passing around
pointers to the endpoint's descriptor. In fact, this is how we refer
to interfaces too. This object keeps an in-memory copy of the
configuration descriptor we're using, so this data is always handy.
There are high-level functions for iterating over a device's
descriptors.

When a device is attached, call Enumerate to reset and identify it.
After Enumerate, the device will be in the 'addressed' state. It
will not be configured yet, but we'll have a copy of the device
descriptor and the first configuration descriptor in memory. To use
that default configuration, you can immediately call Configure. Now
the device is ready to use.

This host controller is a singleton object which is intended to
be instantiated only once per Propeller. Multiple objects can declare
OBJs for the host controller, but they will all really be sharing the
same instance. This will prevent you from adding multiple USB
controllers to one system, but there are also other reasons that we
don't currently support that. It's convenient, though, because this
means multiple USB device drivers can use separate instances of the
host controller OBJ to speak to the same USB port. Each device driver
can be invoked conditionally based on the device's class(es).

    '

' interleaved, so we can receive packets larger than what will fit in a single
' cog's unrolled loop.
'
' The receiver cogs are also responsible for managing the bus ownership, and the
' handoff between a driven idle state and an undriven idle. We calculate timestamps
' at which the receiver cogs will perform this handoff.
